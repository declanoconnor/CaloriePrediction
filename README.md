An essay was written for this project, the following is the abstract from the paper:

Analyzing the nutritional structure of any consumer product is a laborious and costly process. Protein, carbohydrates, fats, sodium among other key elements are legally required and are determining factors for calorie content. Typically, a bomb calorimeter is used for accurate calorie measurement, however, calories can also be measured by nutritional content analysis. Currently, the approach for doing so is the Atwater System or similar revisions of this method. This paper proposes an alternative method by using existing ML techniques to determine caloric content. The proposal is tested on two popular fast-food menus, this paper then discusses the efficacy of the methods and hypothesises other probable solutions.
